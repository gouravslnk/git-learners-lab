#  Git Learners Lab

Welcome to **Git Learners Lab** - your gateway to learning Git, GitHub, and open source - the fun way!

This project is specially designed for **absolute beginners** who want to:

-  Understand Git & GitHub basics  
-  Learn to contribute to real-world projects  
-  Collaborate with others through Pull Requests  
-  Take their first steps into the world of Open Source  

---

##  Project Goal

To help **first-time contributors** learn how to use Git & GitHub by making their **first Pull Request (PR)** in a safe, beginner-friendly environment.

---

##  What Is Open Source?

Open Source means making software accessible to everyone - where the source code is open for anyone to:

-  View  
-  Modify  
-  Contribute  

It’s how developers build together - and you’re invited!

---

##  What You Will Learn

In this project, you’ll learn how to:

- Install and use Git  
- Fork a GitHub repository  
- Clone it to your local machine  
- Create a new branch  
- Add a `.txt` file in the right place  
- Submit a Pull Request (PR)  
- See it get auto-merged when it passes checks 

---

##  How Does It Work?

Each contributor adds a **`.txt` file inside the `contributors/` folder**.

This file must:

- Be named after your **GitHub username**
- Contain:
  - Your **Name** (first line)
  - Your **Favorite Celebrity or Character** (second line - for fun!)

 Example: `contributors/your-github-username.txt`

```txt
Ada Lovelace
Iron Man
````

---

##  Automated PR Validation

When you create a Pull Request:

Our GitHub bot checks if:

* Only files inside `contributors/` were added or changed
* Each file has the `.txt` extension
* No other part of the repo was modified

If your PR follows the rules:

* It gets **automatically merged**
* You’ve contributed to open source!

If your PR doesn’t follow the rules:

* It will **fail validation**
* You'll get an error message
* You can fix the mistake and push again

---

##  How to Contribute

Just follow the simple steps in  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

You’ll learn how to:

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a new branch
3. Add your `.txt` file in the right folder
4. Push your changes
5. Create a PR
6. Watch the bot validate and auto-merge it 

---

##  Why This Format?

We've designed this repo to remove formatting confusion and reduce the chance of errors - all you need to do is:

* Add your `.txt` file
* Use a consistent format
* Let the bot handle the rest!

This way, **beginners stay focused on learning Git & GitHub**, without worrying about complex HTML or table formats.

---

## Contributors

All contributors are tracked by their `.txt` file in the `contributors/` folder.
